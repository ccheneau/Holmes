 *  Units for various aspects of the forecast. Attributes:

 *         <li>distance: units for distance, mi for miles or km for kilometers
 *           (string)</li>
 *         <li>pressure: units of barometric pressure, in for pounds per square
 *           inch or mb for millibars (string)</li>

 *       </ul>
 *       Note that the default RSS feed uses Fahrenheit degree units and English
 *       units for all other attributes (miles, pounds per square inch, miles
 *       per hour). If Celsius has been specified as the degree units for the
 *       feed (using the u request parameter), all the units are in metric format
 *       (Celsius, kilometers, millibars, kilometers per hour).
